# Install NodeJs

If haven't have NodeJS, Download and install via this link https://nodejs.org/en/download/

# Open terminal and cd to the project folder

- RUN command "npm install"
- RUN command "npm run dev"
- it will start the project, and open the application, you will see the UI as shown in the report

If it is not working, feel free to ask me sir. I can fix it for you. Because on window, it might be
problem due to the node version or with the javascript package.
